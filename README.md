# Penetration-Test-Playbooks

I started assembling the notes as a result of my typical tesitng strategy and then added to it after starting a ethical 
hacking course on Udemy. Shout out to @thecybermentor for putting together a great course. If you are interested, go here:

This is a collection of testing notes for what I consider budget constrained tests. I have found that, more times than not, 
sticking to these during testing engagements yields a plethura of feedback and reccomendations to the client, especially 
when you are boxed into short engagement windows.

What is a short engagmenet window?, you may ask. Personally, I am involved in testing that is siloed 
(External vs. Internal vs. Wireless vs. Web App), and they do not overlap. It is all whitebox testing, due to the interest of
time/budget and typically, I have less than 8 hours for any one test whether it be an external, internal, or other.

As I continue to update my notebook I will update the repo, hopefully on a regular basis.

Hopefully there are others that will find these useful to get started or spark an idea within yourselves.
