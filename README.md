# Penetration-Test-Playbooks

I started assembling the notes as a result of my typical testing strategy and then added to it after starting a ethical hacking course on Udemy. A big shout out to @thecybermentor for putting together a great course. If you are interested, go here: https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/


This is a collection of testing notes for what I consider budget constrained tests. I have found that, more times than not, sticking to these during testing engagements yields a plethora of feedback and recommendations to the client, especially when you are boxed into short engagement windows.

What is a short engagement window?, you may ask. Personally, I am involved in testing that is siloed (External vs. Internal vs. Wireless vs. Web App), and they do not overlap. It is all white box testing, due to the interest of time/budget and typically, I have more than 8 hours for any one test whether it be an external, internal, or other. If it can be done in 8 hours, think of what hacking groups can do with 8 weeks/months.

As I continue to update my notebook I will update the repo, hopefully on a regular basis.

Currently the Web App Playbook is still in process and largely missing content, for now.

Hopefully there are others that will find these useful to get started or spark an idea within yourselves.
